ESP32-C3 SuperMicro Sketch with 1.3" OLED display, RFID-RC522, RGB LED and passive 5V buzzer.
When provided with correct RFID tag (line 37) toy plays melody via buzzer, lights green LED and text message "Welcome, my master!"  
Idea came in process of making RFID-activated lock. Ended up being fun video, as "backdoor demonstration joke".
